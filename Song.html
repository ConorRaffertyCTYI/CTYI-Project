<h3>Teenage Dirtbag: A song for Sean </h3>

<h4><bold>
|His name is Sean
|I have a dream about him</p>
|Sean rings my bell</p>
|Got RA meeting in half an hour</p>
|Oh how Sean rocks</p>
|In Kids...</p>
|But Sean doesn't know who I am</p>
|And Sean doesn't give a damn about me</p>
|</p>
|'Cause I'm just a teenage dirt bag, Seany</p>
|Yeah I'm just a teenage dirt bag, Seany</p>
|Go to an RA meeting, Seany, with me, ooh</p>
|</p>
|Her boyfriend's a dick</p>
|He brings a FUN to school</p>
|And he'd simply kick, my ass if he knew the truth</p>
|He lives on my block</p>
|And he drives a Ford Fiesta</p>
|But Sean doesn't know who I am</p>
|And Sean doesn't give a damn about me</p>
|</p>
|'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag Seany</p>
|Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag Seany</p>
|Got to an RA meeting, Seany, with me, ooh</p>
|</p>
|Oh yeah, dirt bag</p>
|No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
|Oh yeah, dirt bag</p>
|No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
|</p>
|Man I feel like mold</p>
|It's Iris night and I am lonely, lo and behold</p>
|Sean's walkin' over to me this must be fake</p>
|My lip starts to shake</p>
|</p>
|How does he know who I am?</p>
|And why does he give a damn about me?</p>
|"I've got two tickets to Sean's RA, baby</p>
|Come with me Friday, don't say maybe</p>
|I'm just a teenage dirtbag, Seany, like you ooh"</p>
|</p>
|Ooh yeah, dirt bag</p>
|No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
|Ooh yeah, dirt bag</p>
|No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
