<h3>Teenage Dirtbag: A song for Sean </h3>

<h4>
His name is Sean</p>
I have a dream about him</p>
Sean rings my bell</p>
Got RA meeting in half an hour</p>
Oh how Sean rocks</p>
In Keds...</p>
But Sean doesn't know who I am</p>
And Sean doesn't give a damn about me</p>
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirt bag, Seany</p>
Yeah I'm just a teenage dirt bag, Seany</p>
Go to an RA meeting, Seany, with me, ooh</p>
Her boyfriend's a dick</p>
He brings a FUN to school</p>
And he'd simply kick, my ass if he knew the truth</p>
He lives on my block</p>
And he drives a Ford Fiesta</p>
But Sean doesn't know who I am</p>
And Sean doesn't give a damn about me</p>
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag Seany</p>
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag Seany</p>
Got to an RA meeting, Seany, with me, ooh</p>
Oh yeah, dirt bag</p>
No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
Oh yeah, dirt bag</p>
No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
Man I feel like mold</p>
It's Iris night and I am lonely, lo and behold</p>
Sean's walkin' over to me this must be fake</p>
My lip starts to shake</p>
How does he know who I am?</p>
And why does he give a damn about me?</p>
"I've got two tickets to Sean's RA, baby</p>
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe</p>
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, Seany, like you ooh"</p>
</p>
Ooh yeah, dirt bag</p>
No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
Ooh yeah, dirt bag</p>
No Sean doesn't know what he's missin'</p>
